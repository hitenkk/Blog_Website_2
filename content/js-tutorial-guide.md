# Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is essential for web development. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages. In this tutorial, we will cover the fundamentals of JavaScript, including its syntax, data types, functions, and more.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was initially created to make web pages interactive. It is an essential part of web applications and is supported by all modern web browsers. JavaScript can be used for both client-side and server-side development.

## Why Learn JavaScript?

1. **Widely Used**: JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is used by millions of developers and is a key technology for web development.
2. **Versatile**: You can use JavaScript for front-end development (with frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js) as well as back-end development (with Node.js).
3. **Rich Ecosystem**: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can help you build applications faster and more efficiently.

## Getting Started

To start coding in JavaScript, you need a text editor and a web browser. You can use any text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom. For the web browser, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are great choices as they come with built-in developer tools.

### Your First JavaScript Program

Let's write a simple JavaScript program that displays "Hello, World!" in the console.

showLineNumbers
```javascript 
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

To run this code, open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12), paste the code, and hit Enter. You should see "Hello, World!" printed in the console.

## JavaScript Basics

### Variables

In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`. Hereâ€™s how you can declare variables:

```javascript
var name = "Hitenk"; // Old way
let age = 30; // Block-scoped variable
const pi = 3.14; // Constant variable
```

### Data Types

JavaScript has several data types, including:

- **String**: Represents text.
- **Number**: Represents numeric values.
- **Boolean**: Represents true or false.
- **Object**: Represents complex data structures.
- **Array**: A special type of object for storing lists.

### Functions

Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. You can define a function using the `function` keyword:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
```

## Conclusion

JavaScript is a powerful language that opens up a world of possibilities for web development. In this tutorial, we covered the basics to get you started. As you continue to learn, you will discover more advanced concepts and techniques that will enhance your programming skills.
